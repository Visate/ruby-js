Ruby, a Discord bot
======

This bot was made specifically for the ~Nyaa network servers and contains many features that only pertain to those servers. Additionally, a few features were coded in specifically for the CoreCraft server run by Rory Mercury.

This is largely a rewrite of the original bot-- The original code can be found in the file ruby-old.js
That file will serve as the basepoint for all future code in this project.
Currently, most of the new code will be found in the indev branch of the repository, but that will soon change.

The focuses of this update will be more Object-Oriented Programming and making the code more readable and consistent in terms of formatting. The features of the old bot will all remain, if not be improved.
Additionally, some way to store data will be added, whether it be by form of a MongoDB database or by many .json files stored inside a folder. This is only feasible due to the fact that this server will only require a maximum of 6. One for the entire ~Nyaa network, one for CoreCraft, one for Orenji Tea Time, one for FPSS Music, one for An Average Discord Room, and one for the Personal Server.

Making the bot more modular and easier to modify on the fly is a really big focus, all for the simplification for the future. Features may be displaced from this bot to Amethyst, a new bot that will be dedicated to managing the network.
